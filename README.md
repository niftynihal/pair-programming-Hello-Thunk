A simple API that allows you to register a user, login a user and view the profile of a user is given to you.

You can read the documentation here https://github.com/masai-school/api-mocker/wiki/Authentication-API.

Do the following:

    Create a single page react application
    use redux to manage state of the react application
    use redux-thunk to manage the api requests.
    Seperate the files for actions, reducers and stores
    Use router-dom to manage routing
    Use redirect to push users from one page to another

Part-1

    Create a route for Registration
    Create a simple registration page that will allow a user to register with the necessary details mentioned in the API docs.
    When the user submits the registration form, it must POST the data to the api and receive a 200 status code. It must also verify that all fields have been filled in.
    If it receives an error status code of 401 it must tell the user an error has occurred.

Part-2

    Create a route called login
    Create a simple login page that allows a user to enter their username and password.
    When the user submits their login details you must send the data to the api.
    If the login data is correct, you must display all the profile information. You must also hide the login page elements.
    On success move to another route /dashboard

Part-3

    In the /dashboard page
    Create a search bar
    User should be able to search for github users
    Show results with 5 users per page (by default github gives 30 override it: ?page=3&per_page=100 is an example of how you can pass query params )
    Keep active page in redux store, such that when you goto another route and come back it will remain the same.
    Create a dummy profile page so that you can test this out
